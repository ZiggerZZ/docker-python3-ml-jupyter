Hold your glock your whole goal is props  You'll never get 'em  My rhythm just fluctuates  You can't o.d. no matter how much you take  I rush your plates  Crack your lenses clean like benzene  Cool like menthol  My shits the end all  Majorly gain your speed slow your role  You lie and like pinochio your nose will grow  Let's go  Underground compress co  Bust these jewels these diamonds out  But still some of these niggas don't know what we rhymin' bout  Mine in doubt  Traversing' the earth like zombies  And rocks your dirty laundry  Presented to the world as comedy  Del rips it honestly that's why the girls are found of me  And don't be squandering your little flow  You ain't got many  You're fly spinning  We constitution  You seek contribution from del for usage  Over these acoustics  I take time out for use of  Harkus representing proof in you walkman  Lockin' competition out of studios  Everyday I live is like a musical  Create my own score  More funkier than shaft on my musical path  Hook  [casual]  They like ""ooh. don't say that.""  When it's lay doe a dat competition where they at?  I diss 'em  Steady at the rhythm  Like a pilot I keep you silent  Through the turbulence words will get violent  Mega doses exposes is flagellant composes  All you get is roses on your grave you misbehave  It's the brave courageous lyrically contagious  Spiritually engage with the psychedelic waves of  An egyptian  We rips then  Cover the mic like the sun we eclipsin'  Cause no light shine through a flow like mine  Casual might ignite the mic for pastime  With one style older than the sundial  My elaborate connection of words is fun how  I display, dismay this way gettin' bissy  Crackers show off the top while I'm hittin' a j  My immaculate style attackin' with nouns and verbs  For the wack it gets foul  Got a full metal jacket off rhymes to press  To manifest under pressure  Past style a lyrical treasure  Never the less I get fresher  It's involital my biological make up composes of flesh and blows  Will dispose of all  When they appear in my crystal ball  I know you wish I fall  ""yes y'all""  Hook  ",2
